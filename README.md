# DiceGame

## Description
This is a simple dice game I made using vanilla JavaScript and HTML. It is played by two players who score points by rolling the dice, if dice rolls 1, the current player looses all his points and the turn, a player has an option to save his current score if they don't feel lucky. Whoever scores 100 points wins the game.
